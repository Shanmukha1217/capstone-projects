## Creating todo app with EJS templating, Node and Express and Mongoose(MongoDB)

# In this Todo list We have below features

# 1. Add and Delete Tasks. (at first we'll get 3 default informatory tasks).

# 2. We can create some custom list of tasks based on need (ex: if we need separate list of tasks for ex: Home, Work, Farm, so on.. )

# to achieve the same we need to change the root accordingly in the adderss bar (ex : /home, /work, /farm)
